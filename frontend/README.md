# Scenic-Stays, an Airbnb Inspired Site

![](./Screenshot%202023-03-20%20at%209.06.34%20AM.png)

This website is a copy of Airbnb, where users are allowed to sign up/sign in, create their own fun spots for other users to stay at, book a spot from other users, and interact with one another by writing reviews from a spot that they have recently stayed at

## Technologies Used on this Project:
React
Redux (with normalized data!)
CSS

## To Test locally:

You first must enter the root directory and npm install all dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

This is the same case for both frontend and backend directories; Enter the directory and npm install all dependencies.
After all dependencies are installed, you need to start both frontend and backend servers
  -Open two different terminals, enter the frontend directory in one and the backend directory in the other
  -Once inside, npm start to start the servers
  ```sh
npm start
```
  Once both are running, you should be redirected to a localhost site, if not you can manually go there by typing `http://localhost:3000/`
